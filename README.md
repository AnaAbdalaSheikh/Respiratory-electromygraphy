# Respiratory-electromygraphy
This repository contains an algorithm for analysis of electromyograms recorded from respiratory muscles. The script was created to work with Spike2 8.16 x64 Unicode (CED, Cambridge, Apr 26 2019 14:14:41). The algorithm analyses several features of integrated waveforms from diaphragm, internal intercostal and external intercostal EMG. For help using the script please contact ana.abdala@bristol.ac.uk. You must acknowledge the author in all scientific outputs that arise from direct use of this script (modified or not).
